# Dialogs

The `v-dialog` component inform users about a specific task and may contain critical information, require decisions, or involve multiple tasks. Use dialogs sparingly because they are interruptive.

<entry-ad />

## Usage

A dialog contains two slots, one for its activator and one for its content (default). Good for Privacy Policies.

<example file="v-dialog/usage" />

## API

- [v-dialog](../../api/v-dialog)

## Examples

### Props

#### Fullscreen

Due to limited space, full-screen dialogs may be more appropriate for mobile devices than dialogs used on devices with larger screens.

<example file="v-dialog/prop-fullscreen" />

#### Modal

Similar to a Simple Dialog, except that it's not dismissed when touching outside.

<example file="v-dialog/prop-modal" />

#### Scrollable

Example of a dialog with scrollable content.

<example file="v-dialog/prop-scrollable" />

### Misc

#### Form

Just a simple example of a form in a dialog.

<example file="v-dialog/misc-form" />

#### Loader

The `v-dialog` component makes it easy to create a customized loading experience for your application.

<example file="v-dialog/misc-loader" />

#### Nesting

Dialogs can be nested: you can open one dialog from another.

<example file="v-dialog/misc-nesting" />

#### Overflowed

Modals that do not fit within the available window space will scroll the container.

<example file="v-dialog/misc-overflowed" />

#### Without activator

If for some reason you are unable to use the activator slot, be sure to add the `.stop` modifier to the event that triggers the dialog.

<example file="v-dialog/misc-without-activator" />
