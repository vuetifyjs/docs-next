# Elevation

The elevation helpers allow you to control relative depth, or distance, between two surfaces along the **z-axis**. There is a total of 25 elevation levels. You can set an element's elevation by using the class `elevation-{n}`, where `n` is a integer between 0-24 corresponding to the desired elevation.

## Usage

The `elevation` helper classes allow you to assign a custom **z-depth** to any element.

### Props

#### Dynamic elevation
