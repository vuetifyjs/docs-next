# Ripple directive

The `v-ripple` directive is used to show action from a user. It can be applied to any block level element. Numerous components come with the ripple directive built in, such as the `v-btn`, `v-tabs-item` and many more.

## Usage

Basic ripple functionality can be enabled just by using `v-ripple` directive on a component or an HTML element

## API

- [v-ripple](../../api/v-ripple)

## Examples

### Options

#### Center

When a `center` option is used ripple will always originate from the center of the target.

### Misc

#### Custom color

Using a helper class, you can change the color of the ripple.

#### Ripple in components

Some components provide the `ripple` prop that allows you to control the ripple effect. You can turn it off or customize the behaviour by using `class` or `center` options.
