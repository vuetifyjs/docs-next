# Dividers

The `v-divider` component is used to separate sections of lists or layouts.

<entry-ad />

## Usage

Dividers in their simplest form display a horizontal line.

<usage name="v-divider" />

## API

- [v-divider](../../api/v-divider)

## Examples

### Props

#### Inset

Inset dividers are moved 72px to the right. This will cause them to line up with list items.

<example file="v-divider/prop-inset" />

#### Vertical

Vertical dividers give you more tools for unique layouts.

<example file="v-divider/prop-vertical" />

### Misc

#### Portrait View

Create custom cards to fit any use-case.

<example file="v-divider/misc-portrait-view" />

#### Subheaders

Dividers and subheaders can help break up content and can optionally line up with one another by using the same `inset` prop.

<example file="v-divider/misc-subheaders" />

## Accessibility

By default, `v-divider` components are assigned the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) role of [**separator**](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#separator) which denotes that the divider "separates and distinguishes sections of content or groups of menuitems." However, sometimes a divider is just a way to make an interface look nice. In those cases, the role of [**presentation**](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#presentation) should be used which denotes "an element whose implicit native role semantics will not be mapped to the accessibility API." To override the default **separator** role in a `v-divider`, simply add a `role="presentation"` prop to your component. In addition, `v-divider` components have an `aria-orientation="horizontal"`. If `vertical="true"`, then `aria-orientation="vertical"` will be set automatically as well. If `role="presentation"`, `aria-orientation="undefined"`, its default value.
