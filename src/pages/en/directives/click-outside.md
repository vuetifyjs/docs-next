# Click outside

The `v-click-outside` directive calls a function when something outside of the target element is clicked on. This is used internally by components like `v-menu` and `v-dialog`.

## Usage

The `v-click-outside` directive allows you to provide a handler to be invoked when the user clicks outside of the target element.

## API

## Examples

### Options
