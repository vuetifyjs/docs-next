# The Vuetify roadmap

Vuetify is always under development. We are constantly working towards improving the existing codebase, as well as adding new features and functionality that help make building applications even easier. Below is a tentative list of planned features. This is not an exhaustive list and is subject to change at any time without notice.

Details of this conversion process are outlined in our [v3 Notion Board](https://notion.vuetifyjs.com) along with information about release schedules, proposed new functionality and more. Vuetify 3 is being developed with the pre-releases (alpha/beta) of Vue 3 and is expected to release shortly after the next Vue version is officially released.
