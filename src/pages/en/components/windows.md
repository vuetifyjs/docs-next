## Examples

### Props

#### Reverse

Reverse `v-window` always displays reverse transition.

<example file="v-window/prop-reverse" />

#### Vertical

`v-window` can be vertical. Vertical windows have Y axis transition instead of X axis transition.

<example file="v-window/prop-vertical" />

### Misc

#### Account creation

Create rich forms with smooth animations. `v-window` automatically tracks the current selection index to automatically change the transition direction. This can be manually controlled with the **reverse** prop.

#### Onboarding

`v-window` makes it easy to create custom components such as a different styled stepper.
