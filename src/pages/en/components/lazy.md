# Lazy

The `v-lazy` component is used to dynamically load components based upon an elements visibility.

<entry-ad />

## Usage

The `v-lazy` component by default will not render its contents until it has been intersected. Scroll down and watch the element render as you go past it.

<example file="v-lazy/usage" />

## API

- [v-lazy](../../api/v-lazy)

## Caveats

<alert type="info">
  The `v-lazy` component uses the [v-intersect](/directives/intersect) directive which requires a [Polyfill](/directives/intersect#polyfill) in order to work on IE11 / Safari. It's possible on some iOS versions will also require the use of this polyfill.
