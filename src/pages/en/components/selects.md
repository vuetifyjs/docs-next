# Selects

<entry-ad />

## Usage

<example file="v-select/usage" />

## API

- [v-select](../../api/v-select)

## Caveats

<alert type="info">
  Browser autocomplete is set to off by default, may vary by browser and may be ignored. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Securing_your_site/Turning_off_form_autocompletion)
</alert>

<alert type="warning">
  The **auto** property of **menu-props** is only supported for the default input style.
</alert>

<alert type="error">
  When using objects for the **items** prop, you must associate **item-text** and **item-value** with existing properties on your objects. These values are defaulted to **text** and **value** and can be changed.
</alert>

## Examples

### Props

#### Custom text and value

You can specify the specific properties within your items array correspond to the text and value fields. By default, this is **text** and **value**. In this example we also use the **return-object** prop which will return the entire object of the selected item on selection.

<example file="v-select/prop-custom-text-and-value" />

#### Dense

You can use **dense** prop to reduce the field height and lower max height of list items.

<example file="v-select/prop-dense" />

#### Disabled

You cannot use disabled `v-select`.

<example file="v-select/prop-disabled" />

#### Icons

Use a custom prepended or appended icon.

<example file="v-select/prop-icons" />

#### Light

A standard single select has a multitude of configuration options.

<example file="v-select/prop-light" />

#### Menu props

Custom props can be passed directly to `v-menu` using **menuProps** prop. In this example menu is force directed to top and shifted to top.

<example file="v-select/prop-menu-props" />

#### Multiple

A multi-select can utilize `v-chip` as the display for selected items.

<example file="v-select/prop-multiple" />

#### Readonly

You cannot use read-only `v-select`, but it looks default.

<example file="v-select/prop-readonly" />

### Slots

#### Append and prepend item

The `v-select` components can be optionally expanded with prepended and appended items. This is perfect for customized **select-all** functionality.

<example file="v-select/slot-append-and-prepend-item" />

#### Selection

The **selection** slot can be used to customize the way selected values are shown in the input. This is great when you want something like `foo (+20 others)` or don't want the selection to occupy multiple lines.

<example file="v-select/slot-selection" />
