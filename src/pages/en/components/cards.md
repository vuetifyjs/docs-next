# Cards

The `v-card` component is a versatile component that can be used for anything from a panel to a static image. The **card** component has numerous helper components to make markup as easy as possible. Components that have no listed options use Vue's functional component option for faster rendering and serve as markup sugar to make building easier. <inline-ad slug="scrimba-cards" />

## Usage

A card has 4 basic components, `v-card-title`, `v-card-subtitle`, `v-card-text` and `v-card-actions`.

### Functional Components
- `v-card-actions`: The container used for placing **actions** for a card, such as [v-btn](/components/buttons) or [v-menu](/components/menus). Also applies *special margin* to buttons so that they properly line up with other card content areas.
- `v-card-subtitle`: Provides a default **font-size** and **padding** for card subtitles. Font-size can be overwritten with [typography classes](/styles/typography).
- `v-card-text`: Primarily used for **text content** in a card. Applies padding for text, reduces its font-size to .875rem.
- `v-card-title`: Provides a default **font-size** and **padding** for card titles. Font-size can be overwritten with [typography classes](/styes/typography).
