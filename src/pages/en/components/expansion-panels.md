# Expansion panels

The `v-expansion-panel` component is useful for reducing vertical space with large amounts of information. The default functionality of the component is to only display one expansion-panel body at a time; however, with the `multiple` property, the expansion-panel can remain open until explicitly closed.

## Usage

Expansion panels in their simplest form display a list of expandable items.

<example file="v-expansion-panels/usage" />

## API

- ['v-expansion-panels'](../../api/'v-expansion-panels')
- ['v-expansion-panel'](../../api/'v-expansion-panel')
- ['v-expansion-panel-header'](../../api/'v-expansion-panel-header')
- ['v-expansion-panel-content'](../../api/'v-expansion-panel-content')

## Examples

### Props

#### Accordion

**accordion** expansion-panel hasn't got margins around active panel.

<example file="v-expansion-panels/prop-accordion" />

#### Disabled

Both the expansion-panel and its content can be disabled using the **disabled** prop.

<example file="v-expansion-panels/prop-disabled" />

#### Focusable

The expansion-panel headers can be made focusable with the prop **focusable**.

<example file="v-expansion-panels/prop-focusable" />

#### Inset

**inset** expansion-panel becomes smaller when activated.

<example file="v-expansion-panels/prop-inset" />

#### Model

Expansion panels can be controlled externally by modifying the **v-model**. Its value corresponds to a zero-based index of the currently opened expansion panel content.
If **multiple** prop is used then it is an array containing the indices of the open items.

<example file="v-expansion-panels/prop-model" />

#### Popout

The expansion-panel also has **popout** design. With it, expansion-panel is enlarged when activated.

<example file="v-expansion-panels/prop-popout" />

#### Readonly

**readonly** prop does the same thing as **disabled**, but it doesn't touch styles.

<example file="v-expansion-panels/prop-readonly" />

### Misc

#### Advanced

The expansion panel component provides a rich playground to build truly advanced implementations. Here we take advantage of slots in the `v-expansion-panel-header` component to react to the state of being open or closed by fading content in and out.

<example file="v-expansion-panels/misc-advanced" />

#### Custom icon

Expand action icon can be customized with **expand-icon** prop or the `actions` slot.
