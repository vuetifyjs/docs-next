# Timelines

The `v-timeline` is useful for stylistically displaying chronological information.

<entry-ad />

## Usage

`v-timeline`'s in their simplest form display a vertical timeline that should contain at least one `v-timeline-item`.

<example file="v-timeline/usage" />

## API

- [v-timeline](../../api/v-timeline)
- [v-timeline-item](../../api/v-timeline-item)

## Sub-components

### v-timeline-item

v-timeline-item description

## Examples

### Props

#### Color

Colored dots create visual breakpoints that make your timelines easier to read.

<example file="v-timeline/prop-color" />

#### Dense

**dense** timelines position all content to the right. In this example, `v-alert` replaces the card to provide a different design.

<example file="v-timeline/prop-dense" />

#### Icon dots

Conditionally use icons within the `v-timeline-item`'s dot to provide additional context.

<example file="v-timeline/prop-icon-dots" />

#### Reverse

You can reverse the direction of the timeline items by using the **reverse** prop. This works both in default and **dense** mode.

<example file="v-timeline/prop-reverse" />

#### Small

The **small** prop allows alternate styles to provide a unique design.

<example file="v-timeline/prop-small" />

### Slots

#### Icon

Insert avatars into dots with use of the `icon` slot and `v-avatar`.

<example file="v-timeline/slot-icon" />

#### Opposite

The **opposite** slot provides an additional layer of customization within your timelines.

<example file="v-timeline/slot-opposite" />

#### Timeline item default

If you place a `v-card` inside of a `v-timeline-item`, a caret will appear on the side of the card.

<example file="v-timeline/slot-timeline-item-default" />

### Misc

#### Advanced

Modular components allow you to create highly customized solutions that just work.
