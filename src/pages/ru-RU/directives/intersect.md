# Intersection observer

The `v-intersect` directive utilizes the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API). It provides an easy-to-use interface for detecting when elements are visible within the user's viewport. This is also used for the [v-lazy](/components/lazy) component.

## Usage

Scroll the window and watch the colored dot. Notice as the [v-card](/components/cards) comes into view that it changes from error to success.

## API

- [v-intersect](../../api/v-intersect)

## Caveats

<alert type="info">
  While the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) is not available in IE11 by default, it can be implemented using a [polyfill](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver)

## Examples

#### Options
